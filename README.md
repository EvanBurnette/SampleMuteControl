# SampleMuteControl

Use your phone to control your [pajen firmware modded](https://ranzee.com/volca-fm-firmware-1-09-unofficial/) Volca Sample!

Chrome browser has a built in midi support, allowing us to invent new interfaces with plain web technology and a smartphone.

For my [integrated Arduino based pedalboard midi controller](https://github.com/EvanBurnette/pedalBoardMidiController) I needed to do a bunch of soldering to add this feature to my wah pedal. But I wanted you to use it to, so I added it to the internet!

This app is experimental: so use it at your own risk... but you already voided your warranty with the Pajen firmware! Why not go further and start using your pocket supercomputer and your opposable thumbs (optional) to create a sick drop?
